      presentation:
        "As part of an internship during my second year of MMI, I developed a web management application for a department of the province Nord in New Caledonia. Developing this application from scratch allowed me to strengthen my project management skills, especially in AGILE methodology, as well as my autonomy. Moreover, this internship enabled me to learn new languages (.Net and C#). Unfortunately, as the created application is internal to the province Nord's administration, I don't have a demo to present.",

For this project, I was further trained in the AGILE methodology, which we apply within my group. I started by working, alongside another member, on a detailed benchmark followed by the design and writing of the game scenario and puzzles. I also handle the creation of various 3D elements.",
